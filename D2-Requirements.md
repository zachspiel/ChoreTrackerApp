1. Positioning
  1.1 Problem Statement
  "The problem of mangaging chores affects households the impact of which creates a dirty, disorganized house and tension between household members if left unaddressed."
  1.2 Product Position Statement
  "For households with a variety of chores between members, the Chore Tracker App is a organizational app that allows for the efficient distribution and tracking of household chores between household members, unlike Google Calendar, which just displays events and chores, our app will assign them routinely between household members in an organized fashion.
  
  1.3 Value Proposition
  The Chore Tracker App is a organizational app that allows household members to fairly distribute chores and tasks to complete. The value of this organized approach to chore managment is a clean house and a low amount of tension between household members. The Chore Tracker is different from other apps, such as Google Calendar, as it contains fun incentives to stick to the planned schedule created using it.
  
 Consumer segment: Households/Household members with a variety of chores to routinely complete.

5. MVP
To develop the minimum viable product(MVP) for this project, we would need to develop the core components of our app. The core component of the Chore Tracker app is the ability to add events and view the event calendar. To validate this, we would create a UI for the display of the home page and allowing user to complete the add event form. Additionally, we would allow users to view either a list of events or the calendar to display them. Another core feature that needs to be implemented is the group designation in order to group users together. This feature would be validated through user testing of the group form.
